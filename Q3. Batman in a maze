Batman is running behind Joker for sending him Acids. Now since Joker knows all the paths of his locality, he guides Batman into a MAZE (n x n). Batman is standing in top row of MAZE exactly in center cell i.e n is odd and Batman is on (n+1)/2 th cell . Batman is a comprehensive thinker he wants to know that how many ways are possible so as to reach the bottom most row by taking steps in diagonally downward direction only. Given number of testcases and each testcase has an Odd Integer give the number of ways to reach bottommost row as output .

Input Format

First line consists of a single integer t denoting the number of test cases. Next t lines contain a single integer n.

Constraints

1<=T<=1000

3<=n<=500

n is an odd integer.

Output Format

Output a single integer denoting the number of ways to reach the last row of the grid starting from the middle cell of the topmost row. Answer can be large so print answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

There are only 2 ways

1 2 3
